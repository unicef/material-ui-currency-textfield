`CurrencyTextField` is a  [Material-ui](https://material-ui.com/) [react](https://reactjs.org/) component. It provides a user friendly experience while inputing currency numbers. 

`CurrencyTextField` wraps the functionality of <a href="https://github.com/autoNumeric/autoNumeric">autonumeric</a> and it is a port of <a href="https://github.com/mkg0/react-numeric">react-numeric</a> in Material-ui.
